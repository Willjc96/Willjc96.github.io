                        <p>Hi i'm Will! I'm a psychology graduate who, since graduating, 
                            has discovered his real passion is less about how a human mind functions 
                            and more so how a computers mind does. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Up until 2020 I had heard of coding and the uses of it, 
                            but never actually understood what any of it meant or what a "GitHub" was. 
                            I can't remember the exact reason for me wanting to give it a try but I 
                            quickly found that it was something that just made sense to me. 
                            I'm a very logical thinker so understanding the very basics was fairly easy for me. 
                            Over time I discovered the wide range of languages and programmes that I wanted to try and learn 
                            but had to focus my attention to working on one thing at a time, 
                            this fuelled my passion for wanting to continue to learn. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Due to a previous lack of formal experience in software engineering, 
                            I realised that the best way to add to what I had already learnt through Youtube tutorials, 
                            was to get some proper training from a coding bootcamp, which lead me to Northcoders.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Outside of coding i'm a big film buff as well as being a huge fan of video gaming. 
                            My (not so) guilty pleasure is Pok√©mon which i've also incorporated into some of my 
                            coding passion projects that i've made in my spare time.
                            When i'm not stuck at home due to a worldwide pandemic, I enjoy meeting up with friends, 
                            playing tennis, badminton, football and spending way too many hours at the pool table.</p>
